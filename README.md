# AutoStake

Based on a BinanceSelenium module that I coded to control Binance website with Selenium.  
Contact me if you want acces to this BinanceSelenium Repository, it is still in progress.  
  
This software will control Binance on your browser to Stake cryptos as soon as they are released. Automatically STAKE cryptos on Binance! 

# Service
We wrote code to send requests directly to the Binance database.
Our bot analyzes the data so that once a staking cryptocurrency is listed, or in the event of a change in APY, your computer can stake tokens in your watching list.

Be careful, the praiseworthy Binance Locked Staking products sell very quickly, hence the aim to get information faster.
